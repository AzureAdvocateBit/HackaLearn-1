# HackaLearn
Hack & Learn your ideas into life

## Would you like to organize a HackaLearn?
Let's make a deal. I'll tell you how to organize a great event and give you all the perks that I can. 
You will engage your community, make your adjustments, and organize a wonderful event where the participants feel empowered. 
In return, the community members will spread the word in social media. 
**Win-Win :)**

## What's a HackaLearn?
During a HackaLearn the participants complete Learn Modules and use the newly gained knowledge to develop applications.
The ideas for the applications can come from the participants or anywhere else. As in any hackathon, there are rewards. 

### How does it work?
First, there's a kick off event. It can be a whole day or an evening event, online or in person. 
Apart from instructing the participants, there may be guest lectures or any activity you'd like to add.
During the kickoff the participants have to do two things:
1. sign up to a learn module
2. set up a GitHub repo for their project.
