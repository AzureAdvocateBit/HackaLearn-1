# HackaLearn
Hack & Learn & turn your ideas into reality

## What's HackaLearn?
HackaLearn is a community event which combines several methods to grow: learning, practicing and engaging. 
During a HackaLearn the participants complete [Learn Modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/?WT.mc_id=javascript-20967-shjacobs) and use the newly gained knowledge to develop applications.
The ideas for the applications can come from the participants or anywhere else. As in any hackathon, there are rewards. 

HackaLearns are organized by developers and tech communities. 
The organizers know best how to involve and engage their community members, so they can adopt the idea and tweak it as necessary. 
We ([Microsoft Cloud Advocates](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/)) are here to suggest the basic structure, resources, rewards, and our help as much as we can.

## Hack
Bring your own idea or get inspired by others' in the idea board. Team up with a group or hack by yourself. Whatever works for you at the moment.
Build a Web Applications which you can deploy with [Azure Static Web Apps (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview).
You can use additional services by Azure (Cosmos DB, Signal IR, etc.), Microsoft (M365, Power Platform, etc.) or third-party.
Each community or event can involve a specific framework or service (i.e. Angular, GraphQL), but we have no constraints here. 

## Learn
Microsoft offers a sandbox platform with hands-on tutorials where you can learn how to use its services. It's called Microsoft Learn. 
You can select specific Learn Modules of your choice or select a path with suggested Learn Modules. 
There's no need to sign in to use the platform. Howerver, when you sign in there are more features available to you, such as tracking your progress, accruing points and achievements, using free Azure resources and viewing personalized recommendations. 

We're suggesting relevant learning paths and modules for HackaLearn. Whether completing the suggested modules or ones of your choice, this is one of the requisites for [winning rewards](#rewards).

In addition to Learn Modules we encourage to use other tutorials, read docs and blog posts, watch videos etc. We have a list of suggested resources and a learn board.

## Would you like to organize a HackaLearn?
Let's make a deal. I'll tell you how to organize a great event and give you all the perks that I can. 
You will engage your community, make your adjustments, and organize a wonderful event where the participants feel empowered. 
In return, the community members will spread the word in social media. 
**Win-Win :)**


### How does it work?
First, there's a kick off event. It can be a whole day or an evening event, online or in person. 
Apart from instructing the participants, there may be guest lectures or any activity you'd like to add.
During the kickoff the participants have to do two things:
1. sign up to a learn module
2. set up a GitHub repo for their project.
